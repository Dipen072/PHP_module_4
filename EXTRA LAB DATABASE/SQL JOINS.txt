Lab 3: Perform an INNER JOIN between books and authors tables to display the title of books and their respective authors' names. 

SELECT b.title, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM books b
INNER JOIN authors a ON b.author = CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name);

Lab 4: FULL OUTER JOIN to retrieve all records from both tables

SELECT b.title, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM books b
FULL OUTER JOIN authors a ON b.author = CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name);
