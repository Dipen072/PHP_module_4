Lab 1: Insert a few rows into the courses table and use COMMIT to save the changes.


INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, credits)
VALUES (101, 'Database Systems', 3);

INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, credits)
VALUES (102, 'Operating Systems', 4);

INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, credits)
VALUES (103, 'Computer Networks', 3);

COMMIT;

Lab 2: Insert additional rows, then use ROLLBACK to undo the last insert operation.

INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, credits)
VALUES (104, 'Artificial Intelligence', 3);

INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, credits)
VALUES (105, 'Cybersecurity Fundamentals', 3);

ROLLBACK;

Lab 3: Create a SAVEPOINT before updating the courses table, and use it to roll back specific changes

SET autocommit = 0;

-- Step 1: Start with an update
UPDATE courses
SET credits = 4
WHERE course_id = 101;

-- Step 2: Create a SAVEPOINT before more updates
SAVEPOINT before_second_update;

-- Step 3: Perform a second update that you might want to undo
UPDATE courses
SET credits = 5
WHERE course_id = 102;

-- Step 4: Change your mind and roll back only the second update
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_second_update;

-- Step 5: Commit the rest (only course_id 101 update will be saved)
COMMIT;
