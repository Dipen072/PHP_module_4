Lab 1: Create a view to show all employees along with their department names.

CREATE VIEW employee_department_view AS
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.name AS employee_name,
    e.salary,
    d.department_name
FROM 
    employees e
INNER JOIN 
    departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

SELECT * FROM employee_department_view;

Lab 2: Modify the view to exclude employees whose salaries are below $50,000

CREATE VIEW employee_department_view AS
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.name AS employee_name,
    e.salary,
    d.department_name
FROM 
    employees e
INNER JOIN 
    departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE 
    e.salary >= 50000;


SELECT * FROM employee_department_view;
