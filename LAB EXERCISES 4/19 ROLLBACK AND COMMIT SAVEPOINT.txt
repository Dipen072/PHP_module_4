Lab 1: Perform a transaction where you create a savepoint, insert records, then rollback to the savepoint.

BEGIN
    -- Insert first record
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department_id, salary)
    VALUES (201, 'David', 2, 55000);

    -- Create a savepoint after first insert
    SAVEPOINT before_second_insert;

    -- Insert second record
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department_id, salary)
    VALUES (202, 'Emma', 3, 60000);

    -- Rollback to the savepoint â€” this will undo Emma's insert but keep David's
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_second_insert;

    -- Optional: Commit to save changes so far
    COMMIT;
END;
/

Lab 2: Commit part of a transaction after using a savepoint and then rollback the remaining changes.

BEGIN
    -- Insert first record
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department_id, salary)
    VALUES (301, 'Alice', 1, 70000);

    -- Create savepoint after first insert
    SAVEPOINT sp_after_alice;

    -- Insert second record
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department_id, salary)
    VALUES (302, 'Bob', 2, 65000);

    -- Commit changes up to the savepoint (commits Alice's insert)
    COMMIT;

    -- Insert third record
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department_id, salary)
    VALUES (303, 'Charlie', 3, 62000);

    -- Rollback the last insert (Charlie), since the previous changes were committed
    ROLLBACK;

END;
